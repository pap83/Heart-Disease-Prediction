Specific Heart Disease Prediction App
A collaborative project by our team to build a machine learning web application that predicts specific heart conditions based on 13 clinical parameters. This tool is built with a Python Flask backend and a simple HTML/Tailwind CSS frontend.

üåü Features
Multi-Class Prediction: Predicts one of several conditions (e.g., Coronary Artery Disease, Cardiomyopathy, Arrhythmia) or "No Disease Detected".

Web-Based Interface: Simple and intuitive UI for entering patient data.

Self-Contained Model: The backend trains a RandomForestClassifier on an embedded dataset, so no external model files are needed.

Dynamic Results: The result box is color-coded (red for a diagnosed condition, green for no disease) for clear visual feedback.
